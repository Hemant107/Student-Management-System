The Student Management System is a console-based application developed using C++ that helps educational institutions efficiently manage student records. This system allows basic operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student details like name, roll number, course, and marks. Designed to simplify student data management, it is a foundational project that demonstrates core C++ concepts such as classes, file handling, and object-oriented programming.

This is a console-based Student Management System written in C++ that helps educational institutions manage basic student information such as roll number, name, father's name, and address. It uses file handling to store and retrieve student records from a text file (stuData.txt). The system supports:
