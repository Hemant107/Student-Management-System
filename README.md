Student Management System (C++)
The Student Management System is a console-based application developed using C++ that helps educational institutions efficiently manage student records. This system allows basic operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student details like name, roll number, course, and marks. Designed to simplify student data management, it is a foundational project that demonstrates core C++ concepts such as classes, file handling, and object-oriented programming.
